`CLAUDE.md` is the canonical agent-instruction file and root `AGENTS.md` is a
tracked symlink to it, so an agent reading either one sees the same tree layout

a second physical copy that drifts, a bridge path that no longer exists, a
`uv run pytest` line naming a module or test id that was renamed away (#614),
and an exit-code list that silently falls behind `FAILED_MUTATION_STATUSES`.
